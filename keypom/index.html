<p>Keypom is an access key factory created as a result of 3 common problems that arose in the ecosystem.</p>
<ol>
<li>People want a <em>cheap, customizable, and unique</em> onboarding experience for users.</li>
<li>Companies don’t want to expose <strong>full access keys</strong> in their backend servers.</li>
<li>dApps want a <em>smooth UX</em> with zero barrier to entry onboarding.</li>
</ol>

<p>Blockchain technology comes with many benefits such as sovereign ownership, digital rights, privacy, freedom, 
peer to peer coordination and much more. The problem with this technology, however, is that there is an extremely 
high barrier to entry for an everyday individual. None of it matters if nobody can onboard.</p>
<p>It’s confusing to create and fund a crypto wallet. People are unfamiliar with the process, technical jargon, 
and the general flow. NEAR’s account model is powerful, but extremely underutilized because it’s complex for 
developers to take full advantage of. Keypom wraps this up in a single API call.</p>
<p>With NEAR’s goal of onboarding 1 billion users to Web3, there needs to be a solution to this high barrier to 
entry for developers building on NEAR and users onboarding to their apps and the NEAR ecosystem.</p>
<p>Below is a table outlining the minimum costs to onboard a new user onto NEAR with a named account.</p>
<div><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>1 Account</th><th>1,000 Accounts</th><th>1,000,000 Accounts</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Traditional Linkdrop</td><td>~1 NEAR</td><td>~1,003 NEAR</td><td>~1,002,840 NEAR</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keypom</td><td>~0.0035 NEAR</td><td>~3.5 NEAR</td><td>~3,500 NEAR</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>~99.65% Cheaper</td><td>~99.65% Cheaper</td><td>~99.65% Cheaper</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Keypom allows anyone to create highly customizable onboarding experiences for their users. These experiences 
can be both for new, or existing users. If someone already has a wallet, they can still use a Keypom link to 
experience an app, and then transfer the assets later.</p>

<p>Keypom allows for the creation of highly customizable access keys. These keys can be thought of as having their
own <em>smart contracts</em>. Each access key derives from what’s known as a <em>drop</em>. These drops outline the different 
functionalities and behaviors the key will have. A drop can be thought of as a bucket that access keys belong to.
You can create many different buckets and fill them each with their own keys. Each key will act in accordance to the
drop, or bucket, it belongs to.</p>
<p>A drop can be one of four different types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple drop.</li>
<li>Non Fungible Token drop.</li>
<li>Fungible Token drop.</li>
<li>Function Call drop.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a drop has been created, all keys added will share the same behaviour as outlined by the type of drop
and the configurations present. These keys can be used to either claim with:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>existing</strong> NEAR account through the <code>claim</code> function.</li>
<li>A new account that doesn’t exist yet is created through the <code>create_account_and_claim</code> function.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shared-drop-customization"><a href="#shared-drop-customization">Shared Drop Customization</a></h2>
<p>While each <em>type</em> of drop has its own set of customizable features, there are some that are shared by <strong>all drops</strong>
These are outlined below.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="doccomment">/// Each time a key is used, how much $NEAR should be sent to the claiming account (can be 0).</span>

<h2 id="simple-drops"><a href="#simple-drops">Simple Drops</a></h2>
<p>The most basic type of drop is the simple kind. Any keys that are part of a simple drop can
only be used for 1 thing: <strong>transferring $NEAR</strong>. Once the key is claimed, the claiming account
will receive the $NEAR specified in the <code>deposit_per_use</code>. Simple drops are a great way to send $NEAR to claiming accounts while not storing a lot
of information on the contract. Below are a couple use cases.</p>
<h5 id="backend-servers"><a href="#backend-servers">Backend Servers</a></h5>
<p>Let’s say you have a backend server that should send 10 $NEAR to the first 3
people that redeem an NFT. Rather than exposing your full access key in the backend server,
you could create a simple drop that either has 3 keys or 1 key that is claimable 3 times.
In the drop, you’d specify that each time the key is claimed, the specified account would
receive 10 $NEAR.</p>
<h5 id="recurring-payments"><a href="#recurring-payments">Recurring Payments</a></h5>
<p>Recurring payments are quite a common situation. If you need to send someone 10 $NEAR once a
month for 6 months, you could create a simple drop that has a <code>claim_interval</code> of 1 month with
a <code>start_timestamp</code> of next week. Everytime the key is used, 10 $NEAR is sent to the account. If
the contractor missed a month’s payment, they can claim the key late but can never use the key more
than what is intended.</p>
<h5 id="quick-onboarding"><a href="#quick-onboarding">Quick Onboarding</a></h5>
<p>If you need to quickly onboard users onto NEAR, you could create a simple drop with a
small amount of $NEAR (enough to create a wallet) and set the claim permission to be
<code>CreateAccountAndClaim</code>. This means that the key can only be used to create accounts.
You can then add keys as you wish to the drop and give them out to users so they can create
accounts and be onboarded onto NEAR.</p>
<h2 id="non-fungible-token-drops"><a href="#non-fungible-token-drops">Non-Fungible Token Drops</a></h2>
<p>Non-Fungible Token drops are a special type that allows users to “preload” the drop with NFTs.
These tokens will then be <em>automatically</em> sent to the <strong>claiming user</strong>. The claiming flow
is fairly similar to simple drops in that users can either create an account or claim to an
existing one.</p>
<p>NFT drops are essentially a wrapper around simple drops. All the functionalities that simple
drops have are carried over but now, users can receive an NFT as well as $NEAR. This brings
introduces some customization and uniqueness to the use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work"><a href="#how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h3>
<p>Every drop has a field known as <code>registered_uses</code>. This tells the contract how many uses the
drop has across all its keys. For simple drops, this field doesn’t matter since all the uses
are paid for up-front when the drop is created or when keys are added. With NFT drops, however,
there is a 2 step process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the drop is created and all the $NEAR required is pre-paid for. This is the same as
simple drops, however, the <code>registered_uses</code> are set to 0.</li>
<li>Once the drop is created, the owner must send the contract the NFTs in order for keys to be
usable. This process is done through the <code>nft_transfer_call</code> workflow baked into the NFT standards.
It’s up to the owner to facilitate this process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever the contract receives tokens, it will push the ID to a vector. These IDs are <strong>popped</strong> off
whenever a key is used. A user will receive the most recent token sent to the contract as the
vector is acting like a <em>stack</em>.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases"><a href="#use-cases">Use Cases</a></h3>
<p>NFT drops work really well for when you want to send a <em>pre-existing</em> NFT to a user along with
some $NEAR. Since NFT drops are a light wrapper around simple drops, most of the use-cases are
the same although people can now get NFTs as well. This means you can onboard a user with some
$NEAR <strong>and</strong> they <em>get an NFT</em> too.</p>
<h3 id="nft-config"><a href="#nft-config">NFT Config</a></h3>
<p>Along with the default global configurations for drops, if you’d like to create an NFT drop,
you must specify the following pieces of information when the drop is created.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> <span class="ident">NFTDataConfig</span> {
    <span class="doccomment">/// Which account ID will be sending the NFTs to the contract</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">sender_id</span>: <span class="ident">AccountId</span>,
    <span class="doccomment">/// Which contract will the NFTs live on</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">contract_id</span>: <span class="ident">AccountId</span>,
}</code></pre></div>
<p>By specifying this information, the drop is locked into only accepting NFTs from the sender and contract.</p>
<h2 id="fungible-token-drops"><a href="#fungible-token-drops">Fungible Token Drops</a></h2>
<p>A Fungible Token drop is also a light wrapper around the simple drop. It works very similarly to how its NFT
counterpart does. First, you’ll need to create the drop and then you can fund it with assets and register
key uses.</p>
<p>You can preload a drop with as many FTs as you’d like even if you don’t have the keys yet. This will spike the
<code>registered_uses</code> and then you can create keys and slowly eat away from this “total supply” overtime. If the
drop runs out, you can send it more FTs to top up. All the keys in the FT drop will share from this supply
and everytime a key is used, the <code>registered_uses</code> will decrement and the “total supply” will get smaller.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-1"><a href="#how-does-it-work-1">How does it work?</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned in the NFT section, every drop has a field known as <code>registered_uses</code>. This tells the contract
how many uses the drop has across all its keys. For simple drops, this field doesn’t matter since all the uses
are paid for up-front when the drop is created or when keys are added. With FT drops, however,
there is a 2 step process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the drop is created and all the $NEAR required is pre-paid for. This is the same as
simple drops, however, the <code>registered_uses</code> are set to 0.</li>
<li>Once the drop is created, the owner must send the contract the FTs in order for keys to be
usable. This process is done through the <code>ft_transfer_call</code> workflow baked into the FT standards.
It’s up to the owner to facilitate this process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-cases-1"><a href="#use-cases-1">Use Cases</a></h3>
<p>FT drops have some awesome flexibility due to the fact that they support all the functionalities of the Simple drops, just with
more use-cases and possibilities. Let’s look at some use cases to see how fungible token drops can be used.</p>
<h5 id="recurring-payments-1"><a href="#recurring-payments-1">Recurring Payments</a></h5>
<p>Recurring payments are quite a common situation. Let’s say you need to send someone $50 USDC every week. You
could create a key with 5 claims that has a claim_interval` of 1 week. You would then pre-load maybe the
first week’s deposit of $50 USDC and register 1 use or you could send $500 USDC for the first 10 weeks. At that
point, you would simply hand over the key to the user and they can claim once a week.</p>
<h5 id="backend-servers-1"><a href="#backend-servers-1">Backend Servers</a></h5>
<p>Taking the recurring payments problem to another level, imagine that instead of leaving the claims up to the
contractor, you wanted to automatically pay them through a backend server. They would give you their NEAR account
and you would send them FTs. The problem is that you don’t want to expose your full access key in the server.
By creating a FT drop, you can store <strong>only the function call access key</strong> created by Keypom in the server.
Your backend would them use the key to call the <code>claim</code> function and pass in the user’s account ID to send
them the FTs.</p>
<h5 id="creating-a-wallet-with-fts"><a href="#creating-a-wallet-with-fts">Creating a Wallet with FTs</a></h5>
<p>Another awesome use-case is to allow users to be onboarded onto NEAR and <strong>also</strong> receive FTs. As an example,
You could do a promotion where you’re giving away $10 USDC to the first 100 users that sign up to your mailing
list. You can also give away QR codes at events that contain a new fungible token that you’re launching. You can
simply create a FT drop and pre-load it with the FT of your choice. In addition, you can give it 0.02 $NEAR for
new wallets that are created.</p>
<p>You can pair this with setting the <code>on_claim_refund_deposit</code> flag to true which would make it so that if anyone claims
the fungible tokens and they <em>already have a wallet</em>, it will automatically refund you the 0.02 $NEAR. That money should
only be used for the creation of new wallets. Since your focus is on the fungible tokens, you don’t want to <strong>force users</strong>
to create a new wallet if they have one already by specifying the claim permission to be <code>CreateAccountAndClaim</code> but instead,
you want to be refunded in case they do.</p>
<h3 id="ft-config"><a href="#ft-config">FT Config</a></h3>
<p>Along with the default global configurations for drops, if you’d like to create a FT drop,
you must specify the following pieces of information when the drop is created.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> <span class="ident">FTDataConfig</span> {
    <span class="doccomment">/// The contract that the FTs live on.</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">contract_id</span>: <span class="ident">AccountId</span>,
    <span class="doccomment">/// The account ID that will be sending the FTs to the contract.</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">sender_id</span>: <span class="ident">AccountId</span>,
    <span class="doccomment">/// How many FTs should the contract send *each time* a key is used.</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">balance_per_use</span>: <span class="ident">U128</span>,
}</code></pre></div>
<p>By specifying this information, the drop is locked into only accepting FTs coming from the sender and contract. While
you can send as many FTs as you’d like and can over-pay, you <em>must</em> send at <strong>least</strong> enough FTs in one call to cover
1 use. As an example, if a drop is created such that 10 FTs will be sent when a key is used, you must send <strong>at least 10</strong>
and cannot break it up into separate calls where you send 5 one time and 5 another.</p>
<h2 id="function-call-drops"><a href="#function-call-drops">Function Call Drops</a></h2>
<p>Function call drops are by far the most powerful feature that Keypom provides. FC drops allow <strong>any</strong> method on <strong>any</strong>
contract to be executed (with some exceptions). In addition, there are a huge variety of customizations and features you can choose from when
defining the drop that come on top of the global options. The possibilities are almost endless. State of the art NFT ticketing,
lazy minting NFTs, auto registration into DAOs, analytics for marketing at events and much more.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-2"><a href="#how-does-it-work-2">How does it work?</a></h3>
<p>Unlike NFT and FT drops, the function calls must have everything paid for <strong>upfront</strong>. There is no two step process
so the creation is similar to Simple drops. Once the drop is created and keys are added, you can immediately start using it.</p>
<h5 id="function-call-config"><a href="#function-call-config">Function Call Config</a></h5>
<p>When creating the drop, you have quite a lot of customization available. At the top level, there is a FC drop global
config similar to how the <em>general</em> config works.</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> <span class="ident">FCConfig</span> {
    <span class="doccomment">/// How much GAS should be attached to the function call if it&#39;s a regular claim.</span>
    <span class="doccomment">/// If this is used, you *cannot* go through conventional linkdrop apps such as mynearwallet</span>
    <span class="doccomment">/// since those *always* attach 100 TGas no matter what. In addition, you will only be able to</span>
    <span class="doccomment">/// call `claim` if this is specified. You cannot have an `attached_gas` parameter and also</span>

<p>The MethodData keeps track of the method being called, receiver, arguments, and attached deposit. In addition, there are
some optional fields that can be used to extend the use cases. If you have a contract that requires some more context from
Keypom such as the drop ID, key ID, or account ID that used the key, these can all be specified.</p>
<p>We’ve kept it generic such that you can specify the actual argument name that these will be passed in as. For example, if you
had a contract that would lazy mint an NFT and it required the account to be passed in as <code>receiver_id</code>, you could specify
an <code>account_id_field</code> set to <code>receiver_id</code> such that Keypom will automatically pass in the account ID that used the key under the
field <code>receiver_id</code>.</p>
<p>This logic extends to the drop ID, and key Id as well.</p>
<h5 id="key-uses"><a href="#key-uses">Key Uses</a></h5>
<p>For <strong>every key use</strong>, you can specify a <em>vector</em> of <code>MethodData</code> which allows you to execute multiple function calls each
time a key is used. These calls are scheduled 1 by 1 using a simple for loop. This means that most of the time, the function
calls will be executed in the order specified in the vector but it is not <em>guaranteed</em>.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the Gas available is split evenly between <em>all</em> the function calls and if there are too many,
you might run into issues with not having enough Gas. You’re responsible for ensuring that this doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>The vector of <code>MethodData</code> is <em>optional</em> for each key use. If a key use has <code>null</code> rather than <code>Some(Vector&lt;MethodData&gt;)</code>,
it will decrement the uses and work as normal such that the <code>throttle_timestamp, </code>start_timestamp` etc. are enforced. The only
difference is that after the key uses are decremented and these checks are performed, the execution <strong>finishes early</strong>. The null
case does <strong>not</strong> create an account or send <em>any</em> funds. It doesn’t invoke any function calls and simply <em>returns once the
checks are done</em>. This makes the null case act as a “burner” where you disregard any logic. This has many uses which will
be explored in the use cases <a href="#use-cases">section</a>.</p>
<p>If a key has more than 1 use, you can specify a <em>different vector</em> of <code>MethodData</code> for <strong>each use</strong>. As an example, you could
specify that the first use will result in a null case and the second use will result in a lazy minting function being called.
If you have multiple uses but want them all to do the same thing, you don’t have to repeat the same data. Passing in only 1
vector of <code>MethodData</code> will result in  <strong>all the uses</strong> inheriting that data.</p>
<h3 id="security"><a href="#security">Security</a></h3>
<p>Since all FC drops will be signed by the Keypom contract, there are a few restrictions in place to avoid malicious behaviors.
To avoid users from stealing registered assets from other drops, the following methods cannot be called via FC Drops:</p>

];</code></pre></div>
<p>In addition, the Keypom contract cannot be the receiver of any function call. This is to avoid people
from calling private methods through FC Drops.</p>
<h5 id="keypom-arguments"><a href="#keypom-arguments">Keypom Arguments</a></h5>
<p>When a key is used and a function is called, there is a data structure that is <strong>automatically</strong> attached to the arguments.
This is known as the <code>keypom_args</code>. It contains the information that the drop creator specified in the <code>MethodData</code>. </p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> <span class="ident">KeypomArgs</span> {

<h6 id="motivation"><a href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h6>
<p>Let’s say there was an exclusive NFT contract that allowed the Keypom contract to mint NFTs as part of an FC drop. Only Keypom
was given access to mint the NFTs so they could be given out as linkdrops. The organizer only wanted links that were part of their
drop to be valid. For this reason, the NFT contract would only mint if Keypom called the <code>nft_mint</code> function and there was a field 
<code>series</code> passed in and it was equal to the drop ID created by the organizer.</p>
<p>Let’s say the owner created an exclusive drop that happened to have a drop ID of 5. They could then go to the NFT contract
and restrict NFTs to only be minted if:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>series</code> had a value of 5.</li>
<li>The Keypom contract was the one calling the function.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for this to work, when creating the drop, the owner would need to specify that the<code>drop_id_field</code> was set to a value of <code>series</code>
such that the drop ID is correctly passed into the function.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that the NFT contract has no way of knowing which arguments were sent by the <strong>user</strong> when the drop 
was created <code>as part of the MethodData </code>args<code>and which arguments are automatically populated by the Keypom contract. There is nothing  stopping a malicious user from creating a new drop that has an ID of 6 but hardcoding in the actual arguments that</code>series<code>should have  a value of 5. In this case, the malicious drop would have *no*</code>drop_id_field<code>and the NFT contract would have no way of knowing that the </code>series` value is malicious.</p>
<p>This can be prevented if a new field is introduced representing what was automatically injected by the Keypom contract itself. At the
end of the day, Keypom will <strong>always</strong> send correct information to the receiving contracts. If those contracts have a way to know what has
been sent by Keypom and what has been manually set by users, the problem is solved. In the above scenario, the NFT contract would simply add
an assertion that the <code>keypom_args</code> had the <code>account_id_field</code> set to <code>Some(series)</code> meaning that the incoming <code>series</code> field was set by Keypom
and not by a malicious user.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases-2"><a href="#use-cases-2">Use Cases</a></h3>
<p>Function call drops are the bread and butter of the Keypom contract. They are the most powerful and complex drops that can currently be created.
With this complexity, there are an almost infinite number of use-cases that arise.</p>
<h5 id="proof-of-attendance-protocols"><a href="#proof-of-attendance-protocols">Proof of Attendance Protocols</a></h5>
<p>A very common use case in the space is what’s known as Proof of Attendance. Often times when people go to events, they want a way to prove
that they were there. Some traditional approaches would be to submit your wallet address and you would be sent an NFT or some other form of
proof at a later date. The problem with this is that it has a very high barrier to entry. Not everyone has a wallet.</p>
<p>With Keypom, you can create a function call drop that allows people to onboard onto NEAR if they don’t have a wallet or if they do, they can
simply use that. As part of the onboarding / claiming process, they would receive some sort of proof of attendance such as an NFT. This can
be lazy minted on-demand such that storage isn’t paid up-front for all the tokens.</p>
<p>At this point, the event organizers or the funder can distribute links to people that attend the event in-person. These links would then be
claimed by users and they would receive the proof of attendance.</p>
<h5 id="auto-registration-into-daos"><a href="#auto-registration-into-daos">Auto Registration into DAOs</a></h5>
<p>DAOs are a raging topic in crypto. The problem with DAOs, however, is there is a barrier to entry for users that aren’t familiar with the
specific chain they’re built on top of. Users might not have wallets or understand how to interact with contracts. On the contrary, they
might be very well versed or immersed in the DAO’s topics. They shouldn’t be required to create a wallet and learn the onboarding process.</p>
<p>With Keypom, you can create a function call drop with the main purpose of registering users into a DAO. For people that have a wallet,
this will act as an easy way of registering them with the click of a link. For users that don’t have a wallet and are unfamiliar with
NEAR, they can be onboarded and registered into the DAO with the same click of a link.</p>
<h5 id="multisig-contracts"><a href="#multisig-contracts">Multisig Contracts</a></h5>
<p>Another amazing use-case for Keypom is allowing multisig contracts to have ZERO barrier to entry. Often times when using a multisig contract,
you will entrust a key to a trusted party. This party might have no idea what NEAR is or how to interact with your contract. With Keypom,
you can create a drop that will allow them to sign their transaction with a click of a link. No NEAR wallet is needed and no knowledge of the
chain is required.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, from the users perspective, they are given a link and when they click it, their portion of the multisig transaction is
signed. The action is only performed on the multisig contract once all links have been clicked. This is an extremely powerful way of doing
accomplishing multisig transactions with zero barrier to entry.</p>
<p>The users don’t even need to create a new account. They can simply call <code>claim</code> when the link is clicked which will fire the cross-contract call
to the multisig contract and pass in the keypom arguments that will be cross-checked by that contract.</p>
<h5 id="nft-ticketing"><a href="#nft-ticketing">NFT Ticketing</a></h5>
<p>The problem with current NFT ticketing systems is that they require users to have a wallet. This is a huge barrier to entry for people that
are attending events but don’t have wallets. In addition, there is often no proof of attendance for the event as the NFT is burned in order
to get into the event which requires an internet connection.</p>
<p>Keypom aims to solve these problems by having a ticketing system that has the following features.</p>
<ul>
<li>No wallet is needed to enter the event or receive a POAP.</li>
<li>No wifi is needed at the door.</li>
<li>An NFT is minted on-demand for each user that attends the event.</li>
<li>Users can optionally onboard onto NEAR if they don’t have a wallet.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, some way to provide analytics to event organizers that contains information such as links that were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given out but not clicked at all.</li>
<li>Clicked but not attended.</li>
<li>Partially claimed indicating the number of people that attended but did not onboard or receive a POAP.</li>
<li>Fully claimed indicating the number of people that attended and received a POAP.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to accomplish this, you can create a drop that has 3 uses per key. These uses would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Array(<code>null</code>)</li>
<li>Array(<code>null</code>)</li>
<li>Array(function call to POAP contract to lazy mint an NFT)</li>
</ol>
<p>The event organizer would create the links and distribute them to people however they see fit. When a user receives the link, the first
claim is automatically fired. This is a <code>null</code> case so nothing happens except for the fact that the key uses are decremented. At this point,
the organizer knows that the user has clicked the link since the uses have been decremented.</p>
<p>The next claim happens <strong>only</strong> when the user is at the door. Keypom would expose a QR code that can only be scanned by the bouncer’s phone.
This QR code would appear once the first link is clicked and contains the private key for the link. At the event, they wouldn’t need any wifi
to get in as they only need to show the bouncer the QR code. Once the bouncer scans it, the site would ensure that they have exactly 2 out of
the 3 uses left. If they don’t, they’re not let in. At that point, a use is decremented from the key and the next time they visit the
ticket page (when they have internet), they would be able to claim the final use and be onboarded / receive a POAP.</p>
<h2 id="password-protected-keys"><a href="#password-protected-keys">Password Protected Keys</a></h2>
<p>Password protecting key uses is an extremely powerful feature that can unlock many use-cases. Keypom has baked flexibility and customization
into the contract such that almost all use-cases involving password protection can be accomplished. Whenever a key is added to a drop, it can
have a unique password for each individual use, or it can one password for all uses in general.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-3"><a href="#how-does-it-work-3">How Does It Work?</a></h3>
<p>The Keypom implementation has been carefully designed so that users can’t look at the NEAR Explorer to view what was passed into the contract
either when the drop was created or when a key was used to try and copy those passwords. We also want passwords to be unique across keys so that
if you know the password for 1 key, it doesn’t work on a different key. In order to accomplish this, we use the concept of hashing.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a drop with 2 keys and you want to password protect each key. Rather than forcing the drop funder to input a unique password for 
each key and having them remember each one, we can have them input a single <strong>base password</strong> and derive unique passwords from it that are paired 
with the key’s public key.</p>
<p>This is the most scalable option as it allows the drop funder to only need to remember 1 password and they can derive all the other ones using the
hashing algorithm and public key.</p>
<p>In the above scenario, let’s say the funder inputs the base password as <code>mypassword1</code>. If a user wanted to claim the first key, they would need to input
into the contract:</p>
<p><code>hash(&quot;mypassword1&quot; + key1_public_key)</code></p>
<p>The funder would need to give the user this hash somehow (such as embedding it into the link or having an app that can derive it). It’s important to note 
that the funder should probably <strong>NOT</strong> give them the base password otherwise the user could derive the passwords for all other keys (assuming those keys have 
the same base password).</p>
<h4 id="what-is-stored-on-chain"><a href="#what-is-stored-on-chain">What is Stored On-Chain?</a></h4>
<p>How does Keypom verify that the user passed in the correct password? If the funder were to simply pass in <code>hash(&quot;mypassword1&quot; + key1_public_key)</code> into the
contract as an argument when the key is created, users could just look at the NEAR Explorer and copy that value. </p>
<p>Instead, the funder needs to pass in a double hash when the key is created: <code>hash(hash(&quot;mypassword1&quot; + key1_public_key))</code>. </p>
<p>This is the value that is stored on-chain and when the user tries to claim the key, they would pass in just the single hash: <code>hash(&quot;mypassword1&quot; + key1_public_key)</code>.<br />
The contract would then compute <code>hash(hash(&quot;mypassword1&quot; + key1_public_key))</code> and compare it to the value stored on-chain. If they match, the key is claimed.</p>
<p>Using this method, the base password is not exposed to the user, nobody can look on-chain or at the NEAR explorer and derive the password, and the password is unique
across multiple keys.</p>
<h3 id="passwords-per-key-use"><a href="#passwords-per-key-use">Passwords Per Key Use</a></h3>
<p>Unlike the passwords per key which is the same for all uses of a key, the drop creator can specify a password for each individual key use. This password follows
the same pattern as the passwords per key in that the funder inputs a <code>hash(hash(SOMETHING))</code> and then the user would input <code>hash(SOMETHING)</code> and the contract
would hash this and compare it to the value stored on-chain.</p>
<p>The difference is that each individual key use can have a different value stored on-chain such that the user can be forced to input a different hash each time.
This <code>SOMETHING</code> that is hashed can be similar to the global password per key example but this time, the desired key use is added: <code>hash(&quot;mypassword1&quot; + key1_public_key + use_number)</code></p>
<p>In order to pass in the passwords per use, a new data structure is introduced so you only need to pass in passwords for the uses that have them. This is known as the 
<code>JsonPasswordForUse</code> and is as follows:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="kw">struct</span> <span class="ident">JsonPasswordForUse</span> {
    <span class="doccomment">/// What is the password for this use (such as `hash(&quot;mypassword1&quot; + key1_public_key + use_number)`)</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">pw</span>: <span class="ident">String</span>,
    <span class="doccomment">/// Which use does this pertain to</span>
    <span class="doccomment">/// This is *zero indexed*. The first use starts at 0.</span>
    <span class="kw">pub</span> <span class="ident">key_use</span>: <span class="ident">u64</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="adding-your-first-password"><a href="#adding-your-first-password">Adding Your First Password</a></h3>
<p>Whenever keys are added to Keypom, if there’s passwords involved, they must be passed in using the following format. </p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="ident">passwords_per_use</span>: <span class="prelude-ty">Option</span><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="ident">Vec</span><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="prelude-ty">Option</span><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="ident">Vec</span><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="ident">JsonPasswordForUse</span><span class="op">&gt;</span><span class="op">&gt;</span><span class="op">&gt;</span><span class="op">&gt;</span>,

<p>Each key that is being added either has a password, or doesn’t. This is through the <code>Vec&lt;Option&lt;&gt;</code>. This vector <strong>MUST</strong> be the same length as the number of keys created.This doesn’t 
mean that every key needs a password, but the Vector must be the same length as the keys.</p>
<p>As an example, if you wanted to add 3 keys to a drop and wanted only the first and last key to have a password_per_key, you would pass in:</p>

<div class="example-wrap"><pre class="rust rust-example-rendered"><code><span class="ident">passwords_per_key</span>: <span class="prelude-val">Some</span>(<span class="macro">vec!</span>[<span class="prelude-val">Some</span>(<span class="ident">hash</span>(<span class="ident">hash</span>(<span class="ident">STUFF</span>))), <span class="prelude-val">None</span>, <span class="prelude-val">Some</span>(<span class="ident">hash</span>(<span class="ident">hash</span>(<span class="ident">STUFF2</span>)))])</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="complex-example"><a href="#complex-example">Complex Example</a></h3>
<p>To help solidify the concept of password protected keys, let’s go through a complex example. Imagine Alice created a drop with a <code>uses_per_key</code> of 3.
She wants to create 4 keys: </p>
<ul>
<li>Key A: No password protection.</li>
<li>Key B: Password for uses 1 and 2.</li>
<li>Key C: Password for use 1 only.</li>
<li>Key D: Password that doesn’t depend on the use.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, for Keys B and C, they will have the same base password but Alice wants to switch things up and have a different base password for Key D.
When these keys are added on-chain, the <code>passwords_per_key</code> will be passed in as such:</p>

<p>Alice gives Eve Key B and she would need a password for claim 1 and 2. For the first claim, she needs to pass in: <code>hash(&quot;keys_bc_base_password&quot; + key_b_public_key + &quot;0&quot;)</code>.
The contract would then check and see if the hashed version of this matches up with what’s stored on-chain for that use.</p>
<p>The second time Eve uses the key, she needs to pass in hash(“keys_bc_base_password” + key_b_public_key + “1”) and the same check is done.</p>
<p>If Eve tries to pass in <code>hash(&quot;keys_bc_base_password&quot; + key_b_public_key + &quot;0&quot;)</code> for the second key use, the contract would hash it and check:</p>
<p>hash(hash(“keys_bc_base_password” + key_b_public_key + “0”)) == hash(hash(“keys_bc_base_password” + key_b_public_key + “1”))</p>
<p>Which is incorrect and the key would not be claimed.</p>
<p>Once Eve claims the key 2 times, the last claim is not password protected and she’s free to claim it.</p>
<p>Key C is similar to Key B except that it only has 1 password for the first use.</p>
<h3 id="use-cases-3"><a href="#use-cases-3">Use-Cases</a></h3>
<p>Password protecting key uses is a true game changer for a lot of use-cases spanning from ticketing to simple marketing and engagement.</p>
<h4 id="ticketing-and-poaps"><a href="#ticketing-and-poaps">Ticketing and POAPs</a></h4>
<p>Imagine you had an event and wanted to give out exclusive POAPs to people that came. You didn’t want to force users to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Have a NEAR wallet</li>
<li>Have wifi at the door.</li>
<li>Burn NFTs or tokens to get into the event.</li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing to note is that by using password protected key uses, you can <strong>GUARANTEE</strong> that anyone that received a POAP had to
<strong>PHYSICALLY</strong> show up to the event. This is because the POAP would be guarded by a password.</p>
<p>You could create a ticketing event using Keypom as outlined in the <a href="#nft-ticketing">Ticketing</a> section and have a key with 2 uses. The first use 
would be password protected and the second use is not. The first use will get you through the door and into the event and the second
contains the exclusive POAP and can onboard you. This means that anyone with the ticket, or key, can only receive the POAP if they know the password.</p>
<p>You can have a scanner app that would scan people’s tickets (tickets are just the private key). In this scanner app, the <em>base password</em> is stored and 
whenever the ticket is scanned, the public key is taken and the following hash is created:</p>
<p><code>hash(base password + public key)</code></p>
<p>This hash is then used to claim a use of the key and you will be let into the party. The scanner app can deterministically generate all the
necessary hashes for all the tickets by simply scanning the QR code (which has the private key exposed). The tickets are worthless unless
you actually show up to the event and are scanned.</p>
<p>Once you’re scanned, you can refresh your ticket page and the use the second key claim which is not password protected. This use contains the
exclusive POAP and you can onboard onto NEAR.</p>
<h4 id="marketing-and-engagement"><a href="#marketing-and-engagement">Marketing and Engagement</a></h4>
<p>Let’s say that you’re at an event and want people to show up to your talks and learn about your project. You can have a scanner app similar to the
one mentioned in the ticketing scenario that derives the password for any use on any key.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the event, you can give out a bunch of keys that have progressively increasing rewards gated by a password. At the end, the last
key use contains a special reward that is only unlocked if the user has claimed all the previous key uses.</p>
<p>In order for these uses to be unlocked, People must show up to your talks and get scanned. The scanner will derive the necessary password and unlock 
the rewards. Users will only get the exclusive reward if they come to ALL your talks.</p>
<p>This idea can be further expanded outside the physical realm to boost engagement on your websites as an example:</p>
<p>You want users to interact with new features of your site or join your mailing list.</p>
<p>You can have links where uses are ONLY unlocked if the user interacts with special parts of your site such as buying a new NFT or joining your mailing list 
or clicking an easter egg button on your site etc.</p>
